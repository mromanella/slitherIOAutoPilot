# slitherIOAutoPilot
A Slither IO bot I created for a netArt intervention project.

To run just copy and paste the code into the browser console and hit enter.

Possible variables to play with:

const TESTING = true; (Logging on or off)

const INTERVAL_RATE = 100; (Sampling rate, how often to check for nearest food an enemies, in ms)
const FOOD_ID_COUNT_LIMIT = 50; (How many intervals to allow the same food to be targeted before boosting away)
const ENEMY_BAIL_DISTANCE = 800; (Distance limit between snake and enemy)
