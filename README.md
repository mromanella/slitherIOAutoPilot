# slitherIOAutoPilot
A Slither IO bot I created for a netArt intervention project.

To run just copy and paste the code into the browser console and hit enter.

Possible variables to play with:
```javascript

// Logging on or off
const TESTING = true; 

// Sampling rate, how often to check for nearest food an enemies, in ms
const INTERVAL_RATE = 100;

// How many intervals to allow the same food to be targeted before boosting away
const FOOD_ID_COUNT_LIMIT = 50; 

// Distance limit between snake and enemy
const ENEMY_BAIL_DISTANCE = 800; 
```
